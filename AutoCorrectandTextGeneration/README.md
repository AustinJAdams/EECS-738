# Hidden Mark.. M..
## By Austin Adams and Ronald Moore
  
### *Purpose*
Build a Hidden Markov Model to be able to programmatically:
* Generate new text from the text corpus
* Perform text prediction given a sequence of words

### *Data*
The datasets used for this project can be located in the 'Data' subfolder of this repository

#### Shakespeare Dataset
The dataset contains all of the lines from all of Shakespeare's plays \
Some interesting features include:
* Play
* PlayerLinenumber
* ActSceneLine
* Player
* PlayerLine

### *HMM Implementation*


### *Discussion*
* The success of the hidden Markov model depends on the emission probabilities
